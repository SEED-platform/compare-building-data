# ASHRAE Standard 100-2024 Data Tables

This directory contains data tables from the ASHRAE Standard 100-2024. These tables provide lookups on site energy use and emissions by building type and climate zone. The data are protected by ASHRAE and a copy of the standard can be purchased from [ASHRAE Bookstore](https://store.accuristech.com/ashrae/standards/ashrae-100-2024?product_id=2579183).

    ASHRAE. 2024. “ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 100-2024: Energy and Emissions Building Performance Standard for Existing Buildings.” Atlanta, GA: ASHRAE.

The default targets are defined as the 25th %-ile of the site energy use intensity based on the underlying analysis dataset (conducted by ASHRAE). In the accompanying spreadsheet in this directory, the sheet's tabs are from the following tables in the standard.

* **eui_ratios**: Table G-1 Ratios of Climate Zonal EUI to Average of All EUIs by Building Type. Data represents the climate zone EUI/Average. Numbers greater than 1 show that the climate zone EUI for the building type is higher than the average EUI of the same building type.

* **site_energy_25th_percentile**: Table G-4 Energy Use Intensity Targets (kBtu/ft2·yr). Data represents 25th percentile of EUI standards for buildings in different climate zones.

* **site_energy_40th_percentile**: Table B-1a Alternative Building Activity Site Energy Use Intensity Targets (I-P: kBtu/ft2·yr). Data represents 40th percentile of EUI standards for buildings in different climate zones.

* **site_energy_50th_percentile**: Table G-3 CBECS/RECS Total Site-Based Energy Use Intensities (2012 CBECS/2015 RECS), kBtu/ft2·yr. Data represents 50th percentile of EUI standards for buildings in different climate zones.

Note that other tables were not transcribed but might be of use, for example, breaking out site electricity and site fossil fuel usage (i.e., Table 7-5a Building Activity Electricity Site Energy Use Intensity Targets and Table 7-6a Building Activity Fossil-Fuel Site Energy Use Intensity Targets).
